                          the dirt, forget about what is on the computer or the notes on your desk. It is also a family
                          activity and a fun thing to do with your kids outside. The biggest hurdle in gardening for
                          beginners is to understand light. Many new gardeners don't understand the difference between
                          direct and indirect light or full sun and filtered light. Many believe full sun means 16 hours
                          a
                          day, but in reality 8 hours is considered full sun. The first step is to get out there and
                          plant
                          something. It doesn't matter how small you start. The end goal is to grow as much food as
                          possible elimanating the grocers profits and putting the money back in your own pockets.</p>

                          beet seed is actually a little cluster of multiple seeds. Sometimes only one will germinate
                          but
                          often they all will, so you’ll need to thin the seedlings. Wait until they have grown 2 to 4
                          inches tall and thin them to be 3 inches apart. You can simply pull out the weakest plants or
                          cut them off at ground level with scissors. You can start harvesting beets when the roots
                          reach
                          1 inch wide, at this stage they are called baby beets and are very sweet and tender.
                          Start by pulling every other beet leaving the remaining ones to continue growing to full size,
                          this is normally when they reach 1 1/2 to 3 inches wide. Most varieties of beets grown past
                          there maturity will tasty woody and tough. So make sure you harvest them on time.</p>

                          gardens and raised beds are both excellent options for growing onions. Space onion plants 6
                          inches apart in rows that are 12 inches apart. Grow them in a sunny spot that has fertile,
                          well-drained soil. Onions aren’t great at taking up water, so it’s important to keep soil
                          moist
                          so their shallow roots can drink up. Water whenever the top inch of soil becomes dry.You can
                          harvest young onions just a few weeks after planting if you want to use them as “spring
                          onions”
                          or scallions. There is no perfect size, just pull when they are big enough to suit you. For
                          full-sized bulbs, let onions grow and mature. They are ready to harvest when the bulbs are big
                          and the tops begin to turn yellow and fall over. Pull them up, shake off the soil, and lay
                          them
                          out to cure with the tops still attached. Any warm, airy location is a good place to do this

                          tubers). It’s important to ‘chit’ the seed potatoes before planting. This means allowing them
                          to
                          start sprouting shoots. Stand them rose end up (the end with the most small dents, or eyes) in
                          egg boxes or trays in a light, frost-free place. The potatoes are ready to plant when the
                          shoots
                          are about 1in long. Rub off the weakest shoots, leaving four per tuber. Potatoes need a sunny
                          site. The traditional planting method is to dig a narrow trench 5in deep. Space the
                          tubers 1ft apart in rows 2ft apart. The tubers are ready to harvest when they’re the size of

                          the ground is frozen. For the widest range of varieties, it’s best to buy online or via mail
                          order. If planting in the ground, dig a hole that’s a little larger than the plant’s previous
                          pot. Plant to the same depth as the ‘soil tide mark’ (if it’s bare-root) or to the same depth
                          as
                          the pot. Mulch with composted pine needles or bark. Don’t add well-rotted manure as this will
                          make the soil too alkaline. Water generously and continue to water well while the plant
                          establishes. If you’re planting a young plant into a container, choose one that is at least
                          12in
                          in diameter and be sure to use ericaceous compost. Again, plant at the same level that the
                          plant
                          was planted in the field or in its previous pot. Firm in well, water with rainwater and don’t
                          allow the compost to dry out. Blueberries don’t need pruning in their first two years – simply
                          remove any crossing or rubbing branches. Once established, bushes benefit from regular pruning
                          to keep them healthy and productive. Prune while the plants are still dormant in late February
                          or March, when it’s easier to distinguish the fruit buds from the leaf buds (the fruit buds
                          are
                          rounder and fatter) You can start harvesting blueberries from midsummer, over a few weeks as
                          they ripen gradually. Gently pick off the deepest blue berries, leaving the greener ones to
                          continue ripening. It will take several years for your plant to crop heavily but you should
                          enjoy fruits in the first summer.</p>

                          allow plenty of room for weeding, watering and picking. Keep plants well watered in dry
                          weather
                          so that the fruits can swell to a good size. Stop mud from splashing up onto the developing
                          fruits by laying down special strawberry mats shortly after planting. Alternatively, use a
                          mulch
                          which will lock in soil moisture while keeping fruits clean. Straw is the traditional choice,
                          hence the name strawberries. Maximize your harvest by using an organic liquid fertilizer
                          that’s
                          high in fruit-promoting potassium. As soon as the first flowers appear, start watering your
                          diluted liquid fertilizer on regularly, at least every two weeks until they’ve finished
                          fruiting. Natural plant fertilizers such as comfrey tea are ideal, or opt for a liquid tomato
                          fertilizer as an alternative. Pick your fruits as soon as they’ve turned red. Enjoy them as
                          soon
                          as possible after picking. You can use a refrigerator to store the fruits, but this does
                          impair
                          the flavor and aroma of the fruits.</p>

                          your watermelon seeds in the ground, right where they are supposed to grow. The soil should be
                          at least 65F for them to germinate. Watermelon seed germinates easily and quickly, within a
                          few
                          days. Watermelon plants outgrow the seedling stage very quickly and they don't like
                          transplanting. Rows should be about 6 ft apart and the plants spaced at 1 foot apart.Telling
                          when a watermelon is ripe is an art. You will get better at it with practice. The first sign
                          to
                          look for is the curly tendril at the stem. Once it is dry, as in, totally dry not just
                          starting
                          to dry off, once it is totally dry, your watermelon may be ready. Maybe. Another sign is the
                          light coloured patch on the bottom of the fruit. It is initially greenish, but as the melon
                          ripens the green tinge disappears and it becomes yellowish. The skin overall becomes duller
                          and
                          tougher. But the most popular way to tell if watermelons are ripe is the sound. Knock them
                          with
                          your knuckles and listen for a dull, hollow sound. The unripe melons have a higher pitched
                          sound. Keep thumping lots of them and comparing until you can tell the difference.</p>

                        <p class="d-none d-sm-block">Make a 1/4-inch furrow in the potting mix. Then, sprinkle two to
                          three seeds into the furrow, and cover them with a sprinkling of potting mix. Gently pat down
                          the mix, so the seeds make good contact with the soil. You can spray the surface with water if
                          it doesn’t feel moist. When the seedlings are 2 to 3 inches tall and have a couple sets of
                          true
                          leaves, it's time to pot them in larger containers. In general, 3- to 4-inch containers are a
                          good size, though you might have to move them to larger pots later if you can't plant them
                          outdoors. Once flowers appear, feed your plants weekly with liquid tomato food, such as
                          Tomorite. Keep tomatoes well watered because irregular watering causes fruit to split or
                          develop
                          hard black patches, known as blossom-end rot. This is caused by a lack of calcium, which is
                          found in water. Leave tomatoes on the plants so they can ripen naturally, which greatly
                          improves
                          the flavour. Towards the end of the season, prune off the older leaves to let in more light
                          and
                          prevent grey mould fungus taking hold. If the weather turns cold, pick the trusses to ripen
                          indoors.</p>

                          Water regularly and feed weekly with a high potash feed, such as a liquid tomato feed, when
                          plants start flowering. Cucumbers on outdoor plants will be ready from midsummer to early

                          in the ground in May and early June. Bush beans need a strong support. Bush beans are ready to
                          pick 12 to 16 weeks after sowing. The bean pods are at their most tender at 15-20cm long – any
                          longer and they become stringy. Regular picking encourages the plants to produce more flowers,
                          and therefore more young beans. Don’t leave old beans on the plants as this will stop the

                          shake the flowers with water to help release the pollen, or grow pollinator plants nearby to
                          entice pollinators (this may be an issue in a closed greenhouse). The general rule of

                          aubergines is to pick fruits before the skin loses its gloss. This can be a symptom of

                          their sides and not flat to stop water sitting on top and causing rotting. Place pots on a
